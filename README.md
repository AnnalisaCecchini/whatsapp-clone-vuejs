    Whatsapp is VoIP service owned by Facebook, Inc. that allows users to send text messages. This is my clone of the Web App Whatsapp.

### :fire: Features
--------

This is a single page Web App clone: 

:white_check_mark: **Whatsapp Clone**  
For this page I followed [Whatsapp](https://web.whatsapp.com/) web app design, simulating some of its peculiar features: 

* You can **search for the desired contact**, in the sidebar
* You can **send message** to the contact you prefer to text with
* You will also **get an answer** from him/her (after 1 second!)
* And **last login will be updated** automatically, based on the last message

Try it!
